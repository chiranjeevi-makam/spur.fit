# Dribble design

This is a dribble design, converted to a React js 18.2.0 app.  

## Run Locally 

Project Setup and Planning 
Initialize a React Application: Use Create React App to set up a new project.


```bash 
npx create-react-app spur-fit-frontend
cd spur-fit-frontend

  
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install 
  npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
  npx tailwindcss init -p

```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```

### Building the Webpage

1. **Create Components**: Break down your layout into components. For a basic page, you might have components like `Header`, `MainContent`, and `Footer`.
2. **Develop Components**: Start with static HTML structures in each component and style them using Tailwind CSS.
3. **Add Content**: Populate these components with relevant content. Since assets are not provided, you may use placeholder images or create simple graphics. 

### Adding Interactivity and Animations

1. **Choose an Animation Library**: Based on the suggestion, explore libraries like GreenSock (GSAP) or Framer Motion. Let's use GSAP for this example.
    
    ```bash
    npm install gsap
    
    ```
    
2. **Implement Animations**: Add basic animations like fading in content, animating elements on scroll, etc. Start simple and gradually add more complexity.

### Step 4: Refining UI and UX

1. **Responsive Design**: Ensure your website is responsive. Test on different screen sizes and make adjustments as needed.
2. **User Experience**: Pay attention to the user journey. The UI should be intuitive and engaging.

### Step 5: Code Quality and Best Practices

1. **Code Review**: Review your code for cleanliness and organization. Use proper naming conventions and keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
2. **Optimization**: Optimize for performance. Ensure images are optimized, and the website loads efficiently.
